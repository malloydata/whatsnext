# Orderable Fields

This would add orderable fields (dimensions, measures, calculations). This is a new compound type like `range`. In an imagined new type naming system, the type would be `orderable<T>`.

This adds a new expression `expr1 { ordering: expr2 }`

`expr2` can be one of three things: 
- A partial which evaulates to something orderable (`number`, `string`) -- currently this is only `pick` statements
- A function which takes something of the same type as `expr1` and returns something orderable -- these don't exist in the language yet
- A field which uses a subset of the the intrinsic fields used by `expr1`

When an orderable field is used in a view, if that field is used in an `order_by` 
(either implicit or explicit), then the view adds a new field with a generated non-human-readable name, 
which is used for that ordering instead of the usual field value. This ordering field is not included as part of the view's schema, but 
metadata is attached to the field indicating the name of the ordering field, so that renderers could be aware of the ordering values for 
post-query re-sorting.

If an orderable field is used in an expression, the ordering is removed, e.g. `my_orderable_field + 1` is no longer orderable.

## Using Partial Pick 
```malloy
source: foo is ... {
  dimension: size_orderable is size { 
    ordering: 
      pick 1 when 'small'
      pick 2 when 'medium'
      pick 3 when 'large'
      else null
  }
}
```

## Using Function

```malloy
dimension: order_size(number: size) is 
  pick 1 when 'small'
    pick 2 when 'medium'
    pick 3 when 'large'
    else null

source: foo is ... {
  dimension: size_orderable is size { ordering: order_size }
}
```

## Using Field

That field must only reference the same intrinsic fields used in the expression.

```malloy
source: foo is ... {
  dimension: size_ordering is size ? 
    pick 1 when 'small'
    pick 2 when 'medium'
    pick 3 when 'large'
    else null
  dimension: size_orderable is size { ordering: size_ordering }
}
```

If `size_ordering` were to reference a different column, it would be illegal.
