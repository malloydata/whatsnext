# Lens is the better word

There has been a long history of discussion about what the thing which looks a little bit like a query, but is attached to a source is called. In 4.0 we stopped calling them `query:`, and decided to use `view:`, but the
suggestion was floated at that time for the word `lens`.

That suggestion though dismissed at the time, is beginning, with [WN-0006](../WN-0006-trailing-refinement/wn-0006.md) the word `lens` is starting to feel more correct.

1) It identifies itself as a cousin of a `view`, as a thing you use when looking at a thing.
2) It also implies correctly, that like in photography, that you can create a powerful complex lens by combining lenses.
3) And like `turtle` it is a new word which suggests there are new things to learn here.

## Proposed Process

* `lens:` is enabled as an experimental alternative to `view:`
* Discussion happens as people experiment with the idea.
* If approved, then `view:` will continue to be accepted, as per our promise to not break code,
  However all docs and examples would refer to the thing-inside-a-source as a lens.
