# Array Transformation (subqueries with arrays)

Recording possible plans for future work, not truly in progress, it isn't clear
that enough databases could support these operations to justify including
this feature in the language.


## Query-like expressions for map/reduce ...

A `map:` subquery transforms rows in an input array to rows in an output array

```
dimension: city_parts is split(city,' ') -> (part) {
  where: part ~r'[A-Z]'
  map: lower(part)
}
```

A `reduce:` subquery performs an aggregate computation on all the rows of the array
which allows the result to be a dimensional value.

```
dimension: city_words is split(city,' ') -> { reduce: count() }
```
