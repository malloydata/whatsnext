# Records

A record is a set of key value pairs. As a table column, a record treated exactly like `join_one:` is in Malloy.

## Record references

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `recordField` | Mostly for `select:`, the entire field |
| `recordField.componentName` | The `componentName` field in the record |
| ``{name is 'Mark', `source` is 'referral'}`` | Record literal |
| ``{name, `source`}`` | Record literal where key is implied from reference |

## Type description

Record types are written `{id::type1, id::type2, id::type3 ..., id::type}` for example

    {firstName::string, lastName::string, age::number}

# Arrays

An array can be selected, grouped, and passed as an argument to functions.

## Arrays In Expressions

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arrayObj` | The entire array as an object |
| `[n1, n2, n3]` | Literal for an array with three elements |

## Other syntactic support

> Note: These are not yet proposed, but are written down for the purpose of discussion, maybe it would be great to have excellent syntactic support for array items in Malloy rather than having to use functions for everything.

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `x + y` | Concatenate the X and the Y array |
| `x = [ 2, 3 ]` | True if x equals the array `[2,3]` |
| `x ~ 2` | True if x contains `2` |

## Function Operations

There is a set of functions which take arrays as arguments which Malloy provides translations for in every dialect. Here's a first pass at proposing the Malloy Standard Function Library support for arrays.

| --- | --- |
| `split(string, seperator)` | Split a string into an array, using the separator |
| `join(array, seperator)` | Join an array of strings into a string, using the separator |
| `find_first(array, element)` | Look for the element in the array from the beginning, return the offset |
| `find_last(array, element)` | Look for the element in the array from the end, return the offset |
| `concat(array, array)` | Make a new array from two arrays |
| `filter(split(address, ' ') {where: each ~ 'street' \| 'lane' \| 'court'}`) | <blockquote>Note: unsure of syntax for filters, need to reconcile with joins</blockquote> |
| `length(array)` | Number of entries |
| `slice(array,x)` | The array starting at offset `x`, to the end |
| `slice(array, x, y)` | The array starting at offset `x`, ending at offset `y` |
| `span(array, x, l)` | The array starting at offset `x`, for `l` characters |
| `at_offset(array, x` | The array element starting at offset `x` (0 is first element)|
| `contains(array, x)` | True if the one of the elements in the array is equal to x |

## Arrays of Records

If an array of records is a joined array, it works much like a source joined with `join_many:`, an access to a field from an array of records (e.g. `arrayName.recFieldName`) implies and un-nesting of that record and subsequent expansion of the query.

###  Aggregate operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arrayName.recFieldName.sum()` | Sum of all the `recFieldName` from each entry in the array |
| `arrayName.sum(math_function(arrayName.recFieldName))` | Sum of passing each `recFieldName` to `math_function()` |

### Query Operations

> Note: This is a remaning disagreement in the proposal.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: arrayName.recFieldName` | Un-nest the value of this column |
| `select: oneValue is arrayName.each` | Un-nest the array into a column with record type |

## Arrays of Scalars

The pseudo field `each` is used to indicate a reference to the array which is intended to
un-nest the contents of the array.

## Aggregate operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `intArray.each.sum()` | Sum of the contents of the array |
| `intArray.sum(math_funciton(intArray.each))` | Sum of the result of `math_function()` on each entry in the array |

## Query Operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: value is arrayName.each` | Un-nest the array into a column |

## Type description

Array types are written `TYPENAME[]` for example, `string[]` or `{firstName::string, lastName::string, age::number}[]`
