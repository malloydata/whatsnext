# Record operations

> Note: duckdb and bigquery call these "STRUCT" which is a C/C++ ism. Presto calls them a "ROW". I don't know what word I want to choose but I am avoiding "struct" because that is going to be confusing when a "StructDef" or "StructRelationship" have  nothing to do with a "struct" internally.

A record is a set of key value pairs. As a table column, a record treated exactly like a one-to-one join is in Malloy.

## Record references

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `recordField` | Mostly for `select:`, the entire field |
| `recordField.componentName` | The `componentName` field in the record |
| `{ name: 'Mark', 'source': 'referral' }` <br/>``{ name is 'Mark', `source` is 'referral' }`` | Record literal <blockquote>Note: Not sure about "is" vs JSON |
| `{ name, 'source' }` | Record literal where key is implied from reference |

> Note: Lloyd suggested `name is 'Mark'` instead of the JSON-esque syntax. This is another example of something that is Malloy-like vs. something that is SQL like and I am shocked to discover that this time I am siding with the SQL people who don't want to learn new things. This should at least be considered because function argument syntax is so similar.

## Query Usage

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: recordField` | Adds the record field to the output |
| `select: recordField.*` | Expands the record and adds each field to the output |
| `group_by: recordField.*` | Expands the record and adds each field to the output |
| `group_by: recordField` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |

> Note: I think `group_by: x.*` on a complex nested record would probably error, but we could do simple ones. Might even be database specific

## Type description

> Note: Not sure we ever have a need to cast to a record type, but for completeness

Record types are written `<id::type1, id::type2, id::type3 ..., id::typen>` for example

    <firstName:: string, lastName:: string, age:: number>

# Array Operations

Arrays are treated like a `join_many:` in Malloy.

## Array references

> Note: The `[]` syntax is used to provide based access and slicing of arrays. This may be confusing to SQL users who except to get these operations with functions.

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arrayObj` | The entire array as an object |
| `arrayObj[0]` | The first element of the array |
| `arrayObj[n]` | The element at index `n` in the array |
| `arrayObj[...]` | The last element of the array |
| `arrayObj[n to p]` | Range based slice, starting a index `n` and ending at `p` |
| `arrayObj[n...]` | Slice starting at `n` and going to the end |
| `arrayObj[n, x]`<br/>`arrayObj[n for x]`| Slice starting at index `n` for length `x` <blockquote>Note: Need to pick one</blockquote> |
| `[n1, n2, n3]` | Literal for an array with three elements |

## Query Usage

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: arrayObj` | Adds the array to the output |
| `group_by: arrayObj` | <blockquote>Note: ???<blockquote> |
| `group_by: arrayObj.*` | <blockquote>Note: ???<blockquote> |

## Other syntactic support

One can imagine other uses of expressions (instead of functions) on array operations ...
maybe even if we like some of those, they don't go in the MVP. Here are just a few
examples off of the top of my head.

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `x + y` | Concatenate the X and the Y array |
| `[ ...x, nel ]` | An array with all the elements of `x` and with one element added at the end |
| `x = [ 2, 3 ]` | True if x equals the array `[2,3]` |
| `x ~ [ 2, 3 ]` | True if x contains the sub-array `[2,3]` |
| `x ~ 2` | True if x contains `2` |


## Function Operations

There is a set of functions which take arrays as arguments which Malloy provides
translations for in every dialect.

I am not sure which of these are essential. I have yet to do a survey of arrays
in all databases to see what capabilities they have. I have started with common
array operations in computer languages, maybe not all of these make sense
for database arrays.

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `split(string, seperator)` | Split a string into an array, using the separator |
| `join(array, seperator)` | Join an array of strings into a string, using the separator |
| `find_first(array, element)` | Look for the element in the array from the beginning, return the index |
| `find_last(array, element)` | Look for the element in the array from the end, return the index |
| `concat(array, array)` | Make a new array from two arrays |
| `filter(split(address, ' ') {where: each ~ 'street' \| 'lane' \| 'court'}`) | <blockquote>Note: unsure of syntax for filters, need to reconcile with joins</blockquote> |
| `length(array)` | Number of entries |

> Note: Names are not important at this point, the operations list for which we need
> names is more important at this stage than what we call the operations.


## Arrays of Records

As with a source joined with `join_many:`, an access to a field from an array of records
(e.g. `arrayName.recFieldName`) implies and un-nesting of that record and subsequent
expansion of the query.

## Aggregate operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arrayName.recFieldName.sum()` | Sum of all the `recFieldName` from each entry in the array |
| `arrayName.sum(math_function(arrayName.recFieldName))` | Sum of passing each `recFieldName` to `math_function()` |

## Query Operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: arrayName` | Select the entire array into the output |
  `select: arrayName.fieldName` | show the all the values of fieldname for each row |
| `select: arrayName.*` | Select each key from the record |
| `groupBy: arrayName` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |
  `group_by: arrayName.fieldName` | Group by each `fieldName` |
| `groupBy: arrayName.*` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |
| `groupBy: arrayName.each` | <blockquote>Note: If `group_by: recordField` worked then maybe this would work?<blockquote>|

## Arrays of Scalars

The pseudo field `each` is used to indicate a reference to the array which is intended to
un-nest the contents of the array.

## Aggregate operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `arrayName.each` | In an aggregate computation, the un-nested value for each row |
| `intArray.each.sum()` | Sum of the contents of the array |
| `intArray.sum(math_funciton(intArray.each))` | Sum of the result of `math_function()` on each entry in the array |

## Query Operations

| Function | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `select: arrayName` | Select the entire array into the output |
| `select: arrayName.each` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |
| `groupBy: arrayName` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |
| `groupBy: arrayName.each` | <blockquote>Note: ???</blockquote> |


## Type description

Array types are written `TYPENAME[]` for example, `string[]` or `<firstName: string, lastName: string, age: number>[]`

# MVP ???

> Note: Once there is consensus about the syntax for all the things the very next question is "what are the steps to get there", and in particular is there a first step which moves the bar for users.
