# WN 0004 - SQL in Dimensions

There are cases where we simply cannot write the SQL expression required.  For example, currently Malloy does not support coorelated subqueries or the ability to call certain functions. 

LookML models are entirely based on this mechanism.  As much as possible, we should try and be compatible with LookML SQL expressions.

SQL expressions are always dimensions.

Let's assume a table orders with nested/repeated items.

## Coorelated Subquery Example
Malloy currently does not support coorelated subqueries.  Coorelated subqueries on nested data are more efficient than joining nested data.

The code below returns the count of items that have not been returned.

```
source: orders is bigquery.table(...) extend {

  dimension: item_count is sql("""
    (
      SELECT count(*) from UNNEST(${TABLE}.items) 
      WHERE not is_returned
    )
    """)
}
```
