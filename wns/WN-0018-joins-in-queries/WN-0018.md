# WN 0018 - Joins in Queries

- **Status**: *Draft* 
- **Discussions-To:** _Slack_
- **Author:** _Christopher Swenson [cswenson@meta.com]_
- **Experiment-ID:** `joins_in_queries`

# Background

Previously, we allowed joins to be declared in a query, though they behaved exactly like joins in sources, 
in that they would not actually be added to the query SQL unless fields from the join were used. This violates
users' expectations when they added joins to queries, thinking that they would always be included in the generate SQL. 
As part of the Malloy 4 release, we moved all source
extension (including joins) out of queries and into separate `extend: {}` blocks. One use case this does not
account for is the use of inner joins in queries without referencing fields from the join.

# Proposed Changes

Allow `join_xxx` statements in queries; these joins will always be included in the generated SQL. 

```
##! experimental {joins_in_queries}
run: carriers -> {
  join_many: flights inner on code = flights.carrier
  group_by: ...
}

Add `join: x` syntax in queries to reference a declared join and add it to the query.

```
##! experimental {join_types, joins_in_queries}
source: carriers is ... extend {
  join_many: flights inner on code = flights.carrier
}

run: carriers -> {
  join: flights // includes the `flights` inner join even though it is not referenced
  group_by: ...
}
```
