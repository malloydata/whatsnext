# Malloy Time

Time is immensely complicated. Malloy presents a simplified version of time datatypes. If your application
requires precise time with detailed behaviors around leap seconds, you are encouraged to use the database
provided time functions, and to consult the database manuals details on how to achieve that precision.

We believe that for most users, using the Malloy time abstractions will be sufficient.

## The two data types

There are two ways to describe description of "when did that happen".

1. Recording what an observer would use to describe that time, which cannot be used to reproduce that time without know where the observer was. Google calls tthis type of data "civil time".
2. Recording a piece of data which can be used to describe when that event happened. Duckdb refers to this type of time as "instant" time, I have experimented with a lot of words, but since almost all databases store this kind of time as offset seconds since an epoch, I will call this second type of time "epoch time".

In Malloy, we call that first time a `datetime`, and that second time a `timestamp`.

In Malloy, there is a "query timezone", which is the timezone that all timestamps binned and rendered in. The default query time zone is UTC, but a Malloy query may have one global query time zone, and each query operation might have a unique local query time zone.

As the query time zone changes, the binning (extract and truncating) of timestamps will change to match the current query time zone. The binning of datetimes is unaffected by the setting of a query timezone.

Malloy makes no claims about what will happen with leap seconds with any of it's time types. It will generate the simplest SQL it can for each the various time operations is performs, and the underying database functions will have some behavior of leap seconds which Malloy will inherit.

There is no way in Malloy to mention a time zone except when defining a contant, or when setting the query time zone. You can call through the native funciton interface to access time zone data, if the database provides it.

### Operating on mixed time types

A `date` is considered a civil time as well as a `datetime`.

A constant `@YYYY-MM-DD` or `@YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` will be infered to be of the type required by the rest of the expression. Alone with no qualifications, it will be civil.

Expressions cannot compare datetimes and timestamps, but you can compare both a datetime and a timestamp to a constant

```
    my_datetime_col > my_timestamp_col        -- illegal
    my_datetime_col > @2001-02-03 00:00:00    -- legal
    my_timestamp_col > @2001-02-03 00:00:00   -- legal
```

The gesture `::timestamp` will be used to convert from a civil time to a timestmap, and the civil datum will be assumed to be in the same timezone as the current query timezone.

Maybe there also needs to be a gesture to convert civil data to a timestamp while specifying a timezone, some syntax for that will appear here in this proposal when that is known for sure.

## Time Operations

### Truncation

Truncation in Malloy is writtemn _(expression)_.`unitName`. Timestamp data is truncated to the specified unit.

For timestamp data, if the query timezone is set, in bigquery, truncation will happen in the query time zone.
For datetime data, truncation is always done without a time zone.

### Extraction

Extraction in Malloy is writtten `unitName(`_expression_`)` Timestamp unit is extracted to an integer number.

For timestamp data, if the query timezone is set, in bigquery, extraction will happen in the query time zone.
For datetime data, extraction is always done without a time zone.

### Measurement

Malloy allows intervals to be measured in units using the extraction gesture, `unitName(`_expr1_ `to` _expr2_`)`

For timestamp data, intervals are measured in the query time zone.
For datetime data, intervals are measured without a time zone.

### Range check

The expression `expr ? expr1 to expr2` is equivalent to `expr >= expr1 && expr < expr2`.

### Granular ranges

All time types in Malloy have an implied granularity. If you write `expr1 ? expr2`, the is asking "is expr1 contained in the granularity of expr2". Constants are granular to their own units, truncated times are granular to the units of truncation.


# Unsupported Time Types

There is no support in Malloy for an interval value. You can measure an interval and store the measurement result.

In postgres, duckdb, and Snowflake, there is a time stamp which is a tuple of an epoch time, and a UTC offset in hours. Malloy will treat this as an unspported type. Writing queries on these types will require casting them to a datetime or timestamp. We may some day extend Malloy time to include this type, that is outside the scope of this work.
