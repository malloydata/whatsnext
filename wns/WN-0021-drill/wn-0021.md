# WN 0021 - Drill

- **Status**: *Draft*
- **Discussions-To:**  Anywhere
- **Author:** Christopher Swenson

## TL;DR
This proposes the addition of a new `drill:` statement available in queries.

```
run: flights -> something_else + {
  drill:  
    carrier_dashboard.by_carrier.carrier = "AA",
    carrier_dashboard.by_carrier.by_month.dep_month = @2004-01
}
```

This is roughly equivalent to:
```
run: flights -> something_else + {
  where:  
    carrier = "AA",
    dep_month = @2004-01
}
```

## Problem

Today, in a query outside a source, it is impossible to write where clauses for private fields, or field expressions which reference parameters:

```
run: flights -> {
  where: private_field = "foo", parameter = "bar"
}
```

In the explorer, it will be impossible to write filters that use expressions.

The `drill` statement allows you to reference a view inside the source and apply filters for dimensional values along the path to a leaf row in that view.

## Details

* Collects `where:` statements in the view/nest(s) referenced
* You are not allowed to go down two different nesting paths, but you are allowed to reference multiple top-level views (e.g. `a.b.c = 1, d = 2` is okay, but `a.b.c = 1, a.b.d = 2` is not)
* You must specify values for all dimensions along that path (omitting them is a safety/data privacy concern)
* The parser will support any comma-separated list of field expressions, but the translator will error if it's anything other than PATH = LITERAL
