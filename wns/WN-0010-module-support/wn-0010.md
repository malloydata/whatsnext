# Modules for Malloy

We fully expect people to maintain repositories of shared Malloy code. In anticipation of this eventuality, the `import` statement in Malloy is defined as

`import` _{ optional selectors }_ `from "`_URL_`"`

The intention is that the import statement for a model named "shared-thing" would be 

    import "https://REPOSITORY-SERVER/shared-thing@SEMVER"

This approach is based on the scheme used in [Deno](https://deno.land). In the case of Deno, they actually host a repository which accepts contributions so there is a cannonical location where modules can be found. We would anticipate such a thing happening for Malloy also.
