# Array Gestures

The decision to ".value" to indicate an un-nest vs. a bare name to refer to the entire array was made to keep development simple, it isn't neccessarily the best way to express the distinction between those two types of references.

we have to somehow rhyme with arrays of records, you'd like to be able to sum `structArray.value.recordField.value` for example, but if `structArray` was an array of key-value pairs
and the reference would be `structArray.value.value` it it isnt clear which one of those
is un-nesting and which isn't.

## One Idea

* There are functions for split and join and other things which make or take arrays
* There are ton of `[]` based syntaxes for most basic things

For these examples, imagine a schema with an array of integers `intArray`, and an array of records `recArray` which have an array of integers `innerInts`.

### Basic Access

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `intArray` | The entire array as an object |
| `intArray[*]` | One un-nested value from intArray |
| `intArray[0]` | The first element of the array |
| `intArray[n]` | The element at index `n` in the array |
| `intArray[...]` | The last element of the array |
| `intArray[n to p]` | Range pased slice, starting a index `n` and ending at `p` |
| `intArray[n, x]` | Slice starting at index `n` for length `x` |
| `intArray[n...]` | Slice starting at `n` and going to the end |

### Aggregate Expressions

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `intArray[*].sum()` | Sum of all elements |
| `sum(intArray[*] / moreExpr)` | Use unnested value in computation |
| `recArray[*].avg(innerInts[*].sum())` | Average value of the sums of all the ints |
| `structArray[*].value` | Previously mentioned struct array of key value pairs |

### Maybe

See what other operators can use arrays

| Expression | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `x + y` | Concatenate |
| ... | Probbaly don't want to do "contains" because you really want the index |
| ... | look at javascript array functions and see what else could be an operator? |

### Casting?

I think this would only be used to specify the return types of sql native functions, but it would be `::TYPENAME[]` to mean "array of scalars of type `TYPENAME`

### Implementation

I think there is a new fragment type for an un-nested reference, and then we deprecate `.value `for a while and then it goes away.
