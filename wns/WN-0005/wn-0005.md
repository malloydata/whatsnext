In JSON, Parquet, BigQuery and other data structures nested data can be either singular or repeated.  Malloy today reads singular data but can not create it in a query.  Often, it would be really useful to be able to return data of a known structure for use in other things.  Adding a 'record' function in Malloy that can group dimensional values together and be treated like a single dimesion would be useful.


## Example
The `record()` function returns a nested namespace `user_data` with elements `name`, `id` and `age`.  Notice that `age` is a scalar calculation.  

```
source: users is ... {
  dimesion: user_data is record(
      name,
      id,
      age is years(now() to birth_date)
    )
}

source: orders .. {
  join_one: users ...

  view: by_user is {
    group_by: user_data
    aggregate: order_count
  }
}
```

## Implementation
Some databases support grouping by structs.  We can build a hash value of the scalar in databases that do not.  

## Additional use cases

In tiering results, you often want a string and a seperate sort order. We could write using the example below, but perhaps and ordered pick would be helful.

```
view: by_status is {
  group_by: order_status is status ?
    pick record(value is 'shipped', sort is O) when 1 or 5
    pick record(value is 'returned', sort is 1) when 3
    pick record(value is 'canceled', sort is 2) when 2
    else record(value is 'other', sort is 3)
}

```

## Records can't be dereference in a Group by
