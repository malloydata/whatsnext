# Malloy Relationships

This is a proposal to add relations to Malloy.  There is a new object type that takes two sources and describes the relationship between them.  The form is

`relationship: <right-source> <kind> <left-source> [with|on] join_clause`

Relations are different in that they aren't named but instead a mapping description between two sources.  The sources are in the global namespace.  The kind operation can be 

`>>` Many to one
`==` One to one
`<<` One to Many
`><` Cross join

Relations are global and can be accessed with global namespace sigel `@`.  I think this is necessary because columns could mask global names.

`Many to one` and `one to one`  relations can use a `with` clause. 

## Assume the following Model.

```
source: users is duckdb.table('users.parquet') extend {primary_key: id}
source: product is duckdb.table('products.parquet') extend {primary_key: id}
source: inventory_items is duckdb.table('inventory_items.parquet') extend {primary_key: id}
source: orders is duckdb.table('orders.parquet') {primary_key: id}
source: items is duckdb.table('items.parquet') {
  primary_key: id
  measure: revenue is price.sum()
}

// each order has a user
relation: orders >> users with orders.user_id

// items has 3 foreign keys, the order, the product and the item when it was in inventory
relationship: orders << items on items.order_id = orders.id
relationship: items >> product with items.product_id
relationship: items >> inventory_items with items.inventory_id

// inventory items also have a foreign key to the product.
relationship: inventory_items >> product with inventory_items.product_id

// source based on a query
source: user_facts is orders -> {
  group_by: user_id
  aggregate: lifetime_orders is orders.count()
}

// this could be joined from 'order'
relationship: users == user_facts with users.id
relationship: orders >> user_facts with orders.user_id

```

## Orders by product 

Written with global relations

```
run: orders -> {
  group_by: @items.@product.name
  aggregate: @items.revenue
}
```

## Users that haven't ordered

```
run: users -> {
  group_by: id, full_name
  having: @orders.count() = 0
}
```

## inventory items in stock.
```
run: inventory_items -> {
  group_by: id, @products.name, quantity
  aggregate:
    quantity_sold is @items.count()
    on_hand is quantity - @items.count()
    cost_of_goods_sold is cost * @items.count()
}
```


## relations to queries.

Let's assume we have an query in items.

```
source: items is duckdb.table('items.parquet') {
  primary_key: id
  measure: revenue is price.sum()

  view: inventory_facts is {
    group_by: inventory_item_id // automatic detection of primary_key
    aggregate: 
      quantity_sold is count()
      revenue
  }
}
```

We can have a relation based on a query.

relationship: inventory_items == inventory_facts is items->inventory_facts with inventory_items.id

We can then rewrite the above query:

```
run: inventory_items -> {
  select:
    id
    @products.name 
    @inventory_facts.quantity_sold
    on_hand is @inventory_facts.quantity_sold - quantity
    cost_of_goods_sold is @inventory_facts.quantity_sold * cost
}
```
