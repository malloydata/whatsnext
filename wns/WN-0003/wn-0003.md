# WN 0003 - Unknown Aggregate and Analytic Functions

We can handle unknown scalar functions in the Malloy but we have to use an ugly workaround for aggregate functions and analytic/window functions are impossible today.  This is a proposal would allow the use of unknown analytic and window functons.

From the current Documentations:

> Many functions available in SQL are available unchanged in Malloy. Malloy provides some compatibility transformations for known functions. Unknown functions may be called like cbrt!(x) or timestamp_seconds!timestap(value) to specify a return type. For detailed information, as well as a full list of all available functions, see the Functions section.


Proposal, add more information to the functions so we can know if a function is scalar, aggregate or analytic

`calculate: per_rank is percentile_rank!number!analytic()`

`aggregate: a_count is approximate_count_distinct!number!aggregate(user_id)`
