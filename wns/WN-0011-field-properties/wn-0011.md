# Today's "Field Properties"

Today, aggregate expressions can have a where clause appended: e.g. `sum() { where: something }`.

# Proposal 

Field expressions can be followed by "field properties" which can be any of the following:
- A limit clause: e.g. `limit: 10`
- A where clause: e.g. `where: something = something_else`
- An order by clause: e.g. `order_by: something`
- A partition by clause: e.g. `partition_by: something`

Any aggregate expression can use a where clause.

Aggregate functions may support `order_by` and/or `limit`. Today the only function this would apply to is `string_agg`.

Window functions can use `partition_by` and `order_by`. 

Any other use will result in a semantic parse error.

# Syntax

The specific syntax in the grammar would be `OCURLY (fieldPropertyStatement | SEMI)* CCURLY`
