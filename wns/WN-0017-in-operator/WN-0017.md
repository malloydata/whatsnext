# WN 0017 - The IN Operator

- **Status**: **Accepted**
- **Author:** Michael Toy\<michaeltoy@meta.com>

## Overview 

* _expression_ `IN (` _expressionList_ `)`
* _expression_ `NOT IN (`_expressionList_ `)`
* `IN` and `NOT IN` are compare operators which means they, like all other comparison operators also work with partial evaluation
  * _expr_ `? IN (val1,val2,val3,val4) & != computedExcludedValue`

## Null behavior

Like other equality comparisons in Malloy, and unlike SQL, Malloy `IN` always returns a `true` or a `false`. Which means it will always be generated as

* `x in (y,z)` => `COALESCE(x in (y,z),false)`
* `x not in (y,z)` => `COALESCE(x not in (y,z),true)`
