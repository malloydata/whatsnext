# Adding Parameters to Malloy

There are several main uses cases for parameters in Malloy 

  * parameterized filters 
  * parameterized data sources in data functions (dimension, measures and views)
  * parameterizing the location of a physical data source

## Parameterized Filters

Parameterized filters crate an API to a source, query or view.  There are lots of use cases here.  I'm going to assume Looker string filters throughout this document.

Filter types:  

* `time_filter`
* `string_filter`
* `numeric_filter`

There is one single function for filters, `.match(filter)` that returns a boolean if the filter matches.  

example: 
  * `order_time.match("1 day")` 
  * `match(">0.2", revenue-cost/cost)`


## In the example below, `when_ordered` is a parameter to orders.  
In order to use the `orders` source you must provide a parameter to when ordered

```
source: orders(time_filter: when_ordered) is {
  where: order_time.match(when_ordered)

  view: stats is {
    aggregate: total_revenue is items.price.sum(), total_cost is items.cost.sum()
  }
}

run: orders(when_ordered='1 day ago') -> stats
```

## Default value
Transactional tables grow over time.  Often these tables have a time based field where you must provide a filter.  

```
source: orders(time_filter: when_ordered='1 day ago') is {
  where: order_time.match(when_ordered)

  view: stats is {
    aggregate: total_revenue is items.price.sum(), total_cost is items.cost.sum()
  }
}

run: orders -> stats
```

In this case we can run a query against orders without a filter and it will always provide one.

## Special value empty strings or 'ALL'
In the case of a default filter, you might wish to run a query that doesn't respect the default value.  ALL is an alias for an empty filter string.

```
source: orders(time_filter: when_ordered='1 day ago') is {
  where: order_time.match(when_ordered)

  view: stats is {
    aggregate: total_revenue is items.price.sum(), total_cost is items.cost.sum()
  }
}

run: orders(when_orderd=ALL)-> stats
run: orders(when_orderd='')-> stats
```

## Parameterzed Views
There are lots of uses for parameterized views.  Accessing the filter string in annotations is pretty important.

```
source: airport is ... {
  measure: airport_count is 

  view: compare_states(
    string_filter: state1
    string_filter: state2
    ) is {
    group_by: facility_type
    aggreate: 
      airport_count
      # label="airport_count ${state1}"
      airport_count_state1 is airport_count {where: state.match(state1)}
      # label= "airport_count ${state2}
      airport_count_state2 is airport_count {where: state.match(state2)}
  }
}

run: airports -> compare_states(state1='CA', state2='NY')
// compare east coast and west coast
run: airports -> compare_states(state1='CA,OR,WA', state2='NY,MA,CT,RI,PA,NC,SC,GA,FL')
```

## Parameter Annotations
Parameters can be annotated.  The annotations can be used by a frontend tool.  We should probably have some conventions as to possible values, but not enforce them in the language.  Annotations should facilitate creation of filter user interfaces.

```
source: orders(
  # label="Order Date"
  time_filter: when_ordered='1 day ago'
  # label="Order Status" possible_values=[COMPLETE,RETURNED,CANCELLED]
  string_filter: f_order_status="COMPLETE"
  ) is {
  where: 
    order_time.match(when_ordered)
    and order_status.match(f_order_status)

  view: stats is {
    aggregate: total_revenue is items.price.sum(), total_cost is items.cost.sum()
  }
}

run: orders(when_ordered=ALL, order_status='RETURNED')-> stats
run: orders(order_status='RETURNED,CANCELLED')-> stats
```

## Constant Parameters
There are cases where you would like to pass a constant value.  These types are

* number_parameter
* string_parameter
* date_parameter

These parameters can be uses in sources, views, dimensions and measures.  String constants can be substituted in any language constant string. 


## Helper functions
* `begin_date(time_filter)` - returns date constant
* `end_date(time_filter)`
* `begin_time(time_filter)` - returns timestamp constant
* `end_time(time_filter)`


# Absract dimensions, measures, views and sources
There is another use case that has a similar syntax but is used differently, abstract sources that essentially let us implment functions

Let's start with a simple use case.

```
// global dimension
dimension: cap_first(string_dimension: s) is concat(upper(substring(s,1,1),substring(s,2)))

source: users ... {
  dimension: cap_name is cap_first(name)
}
```

## Abstract views let us build reusable query shapes.

```
view: top_values(string_dimension: s, number_parameter: n=5) is {
  group_by: s
  aggregate: cardinality is count is count()
  limit: n
}

run: duckdb.table('airports.parquet') -> top_values(state, 4)

```
